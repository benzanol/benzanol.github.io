            For more information on Apollonian Circle Packings, and the graph shown at right, check
            out
            <a href="https://web.colby.edu/janholly/files/2021/11/Holly21pdf.pdf">this</a> paper
        </p>
        <p>Use arrow keys (or vim keys) and +/- to navigate around the packing.</p>
        <p>
            Use WASD to change each radius ratio (each is between 0 and 1) of the 3 circles
            generating the packing. The red dot indicates where on the graph this packing lies (the
            x axis is ratio of the largest radius to the second largest, the y axis is the ratio of
            the second largest radius to the smallest.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The dark lines on the graph represent half-plane packings, which occurs when the edges
            of the circles in the packing align to create a line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intersections of two dark lines on the graph represent line packings, which occur when
            the edges of the circles perfectly align to create two lines, bounding the packing from
            above and below.
